Create a table for this assignment named snowboard. In this table you need at least the following columns: id, boardtype, brand, msrp, size. The main objective of this project is to manage snowboards. For this homework we're developing only APIs, no user interface or command line input/output. APIs will be tested and graded using Postman.
